I also like to design and make stuff using Photoshop, Figma, Clip Studio, and Procreate. I've also done other cool stuff like animation and music production in my past work. Some of the things I do for fun are photography, baking, playing video games, and if the weather is nice hiking.",
        "I've graduated with an Associates degree Web Design, and more recently graduated from a coding bootcamp called Flatiron School with a certificate in Software Engineering. However a lot of what I know now I taught myself, or taught by teachers on Udemy and YouTube. Learning is a daily effort of mine, and is something I look forward to keeping up in my future.",
        "Currently I'm building a web application that gives people the best solution for storing and organizing their cooking and baking recipes. I also am open to freelance development and design work. I'm always open to new opportunities, so if you're interested in hiring me or want to know more about me feel free to reach out and we can talk."],

The front end was styled using SASS, and uses CSS flex throughout the styling to give responsiveness and to make the styling process easier.",
